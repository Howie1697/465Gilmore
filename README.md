The aforementioned project had a development guide, but it wasn't flawless, and there were numerous occasions where refactoring was required. Since some of the installed component versions are more recent than those for which the original code was developed, adjustments had to be done in order to ensure that routes and other components functioned properly. There was a bit of an initial learning curve because Javascript is not my primary language. But since I excel at solving problems, I don't really see debugging as a chore but rather as an enjoyable exploration of the code. Making the idea work was therefore a highly rewarding learning experience.

In all areas of my life, including the aforementioned one, I approach problem-solving logically and rigorously. I typically know the capabilities and limits of the tools I'm using while I'm addressing an issue, so working swiftly needs me to take each step at a time. I'm extremely good at taking a step back from the details to see the big picture for what it is, and then I can dive back in to the details to see how they relate to the larger issue or solution.
